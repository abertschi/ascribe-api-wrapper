This ascribe API Python wrapper was originally developed by Oskar Paolini in
September 2015, at the ascribe CONSTRUCT Hackathon, held at the Creators Hack
Lab, in Berlin, Germany.

Very often, starting something requires one to overcome some kind of inertia.

We are grateful to Oskar who overcame this kind of inertia with his original
work!
